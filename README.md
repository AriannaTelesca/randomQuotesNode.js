node.js random quotes 

Random Quotes is a projet in node.js.

I have created a function with random adjectives, nouns and adverbs to obtain fakes quotes. In order to create the name of the authors, I have created a function wich links a random name of my classmates with a random lastname of a writer.

The api I have created is placed on the database MongoDB. To obtain all the data you have to follow the route /getAll but it is also possible to run a search by author (route: /author name).
