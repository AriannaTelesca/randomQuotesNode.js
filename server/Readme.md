## Random Quotes ##

Random Quotes is a project in node.js.

I created a function with random adjectives, nouns and adverbs to have fakes quotes. For the authors I created a function to add a name of my classmates to the lastname of a writer. 

The api I have created is pushed on the database MongoDB. To have all the data you have to follow the route /getAll but it is possible also the search by author (/author name).
